        <!-- About Me

I'm Valentine Kalu, a software engineer studying for a BSc. in Software Engineering at the African Leadership University. In 2019, I was captivated by the inner workings of software in computers, gaming consoles, and aeronautics. I'm from Nigeria and deeply passionate about tech-driven innovation.

With a background in leadership, technical support, and management, I've enhanced customer experiences, driven events, and co-founded a record label startup. My technical skills include HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, and digital marketing.
